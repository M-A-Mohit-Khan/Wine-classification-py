# Wine Classification Project

## Overview
This project involves classifying different classes of wine using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is included in the `sklearn.datasets` module. The project explores the accuracy of different classification algorithms to identify the most suitable one for this task.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset contains 178 samples of wine with 13 features each. These features include chemical properties of the wine. There are three classes of wine in the target variable.

### Features
- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline

### Target
The target variable contains three classes:
- Class 0
- Class 1
- Class 2

## Dependencies
The project requires the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
